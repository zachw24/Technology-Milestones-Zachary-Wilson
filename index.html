      <p class="zach">This is a story about<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/history-of-video-games"> History of Video Games</a>. Video games have been a growing sensation since 1952 when British Professor A.S. Douglas created “OXO”. This game is known today as tic-tac-toe. Video games today are at an all-time high in sales. Video games make up to $100 billion in just global industry. Nearly two-thirds of American homes have someone that plays video games on a regular basis. During the 1960’s the dawn of the home console came into play with the developers at Sanders Associates, Inc. They went on to develop a prototype multiplayer that could be played on a home television during 1967. This system was known as “The Brown Box.” Ralph Baer the creator was known as the Father of Video Games, licensed his product to Magnavox who then sold it to the public consumer as what we know as the Odyssey. Moving forward, throughout the 1970’s and 80’s major video game milestones included: Space Invaders, launch of Activision, Pac-Man, Donkey-Kong, and Microsoft’s Flight Simulator. During 1983 there was a video game crash eventually bankrupting major companies, but after several years video games rose again. Lastly, we came to conclusion of the modern-day video game console clash which began in 1989 compared to today with Xbox, PlayStation, and Wii.</p>

          <p class="google">This is a story about<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/the-history-of-apple-computers-1991454"> History of Apple Computers</a>. Apple was not a wealthy company in the begging. It started with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Originally l=known as Apple Computers began in 1976. Both worked out of their garages in Los Altos, California. That same year they debuted the Apple 1. This consisted of a single motherboard. Roughly, one year late the Apple 2 was debuted. Which led to a new keyboard and case, and a new set of expansion slots. In 1980, the Apple 3 was released. This computer had to many problems and made Apples reputation plummet. The first ever computer with GUI was the Apple Lisa. Four years later Apple introduced the most successful product to date. This was the Macintosh Computer. This computer was the first with a built in screen and mouse. During this time, New York Times reported that this was a begging of a “revolution in personal computing.” Jobs was later forced away from Apple because of disagreements, which led to The Macintosh to change over the next ten years. In the 1990’s three new models were released. These models included the Macintosh Classic, Macintosh LC, and Macintosh IIsi. One year later Apple released the PowerBook the earliest laptop computer in the franchise. In 1997, Jobs came back as an interim CEO, and released what we know today as the iMac. During the last decade, Apple has continued to release newer versions of the IMac and has even released new MacBook laptops.</p>

       <h1 class="led">LED Display</h1>
          <P class="hey">This is a story about<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_display"> LED Display</a> Overall, A LED display is a flat panel display that uses an array of light-emitting diodes as pixels for a video display. The LED diodes came into existence in 1962 and were in primary color of red for the first decade that they were in use. Nick Holonyak, Jr. invented the first particle. He invented it in 1962. The first commercial use practical was invented by Hewlett-Packard in 1968. One year later, it was incorporated into the HP’s display and it became a digital Display.  This became the basis for LED displays for the coming future. The efficient blue LED was not completed until the late 1980 is which resulted in a more efficient cost. In the late 1980s, Aluminum Indium Gallium Phosphide LEDs arrived. This led to a more efficient source of red and amber, which were used in informational displays. Throughout this time, full color still was not possible. Green, Blue, and Yellow LED has needed a drastic improvement. This did not happen until Shuji Nakumura announced the new changes, which opened new possibilities to the LED video displays. Overall, if it was not for Shuji improvements throughout this time we would not have what we have today for big LED screens in churches, gaming stadiums, and even sports stadiums.</p>
