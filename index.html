    <p>This is a story about<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/history-of-video-games"> History of Video Games</a>. Video games have been a growing sensation since 1952 when British Professor A.S. Douglas created “OXO”. This game is known today as tic-tac-toe. Video games today are at an all-time high in sales. Video games make up to $100 billion in just global industry. Nearly two-thirds of American homes have someone that plays video games on a regular basis. During the 1960’s the dawn of the home console came into play with the developers at Sanders Associates, Inc. They went on to develop a prototype multiplayer that could be played on a home television during 1967. This system was known as “The Brown Box.” Ralph Baer the creator was known as the Father of Video Games, licensed his product to Magnavox who then sold it to the public consumer as what we know as the Odyssey. Moving forward, throughout the 1970’s and 80’s major video game milestones included: Space Invaders, launch of Activision, Pac-Man, Donkey-Kong, and Microsoft’s Flight Simulator.</p>
